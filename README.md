# RedBeanExample
Fairly plain [RedBean](https://github.com/gabordemooij/redbean) crud example in oop.
If interested, clone the repo and run `composer update`.

The database is automatically created by RedBean and will be called `RedBean.db`but you can change the name in the `bootstrap/config.php`.

The routing is handled by [Bramus](https://github.com/bramus/router).
The view is plain php handled by [Dabl](https://github.com/ManifestWebDesign/dabl-view).
The wonderful [Whoops](https://github.com/filp/whoops) is also in there.

The `PageController` should be fairly straight forward and it illustrates how easy it is to use RedBean.

All credits go to [belletarde](https://github.com/belletarde/RedBean). I merely translated the project into oop.
